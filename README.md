# ida-devices

This project provides diagnostics for various sensors on Raspberry Pi and Ubuntu systems.

## ðŸš€ Installing code

### **Option 1: System-Wide Installation (Recommended)**

This installs everything globally for seamless usage.

1. Clone the repository -

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_repo/ida-devices.git
   ```

   in the home directory (usually the directory that the terminal starts in - denoted by `~`).

2. Copy `psql_credentials_cloud` into the `ida-devices` directory.

3. Install Python libraries not included in the standard Python distribution -
   ```sh
   pip install .
   ```
   inside the `ida-devices` directory.

### **Option 2: Using a Virtual Environment (Optional)**

If you prefer to keep dependencies isolated, you can use a virtual environment:

1. Clone the repository -

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_repo/ida-devices.git
   ```

   in the home directory (usually the directory that the terminal starts in - denoted by `~`).

2. Copy `psql_credentials_cloud` into the `ida-devices` directory.

3. Create and activate a virtual environment inside the `ida-devices` directory:

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # need to run this for every new terminal
   ```

4. Install Python libraries not included in the standard Python distribution -
   ```sh
   pip install .
   ```
   inside the `ida-devices` directory.

## ðŸ”§ Installing Devices

To install devices and configure them to run at startup, use the `install_devices.sh` script.

### **Adding Devices to Startup**

```sh
bash install_devices.sh
```

1. Select **"Add devices to startup"** from the menu.
2. Choose the devices from the numbered list.
3. Confirm the selection, and the script will update the startup configuration.
4. Devices will now automatically start on reboot and be monitored by `cron` every 5 mins to check for crash.

### **Removing Devices from Startup**

To remove a device from automatic startup:

```sh
bash install_devices.sh
```

1. Select **"Remove devices from startup"** from the menu.
2. Choose the devices you wish to remove.
3. Confirm the selection, and the script will update the startup configuration.
4. Removed devices will no longer start automatically but can be run manually.

## ðŸ“Ÿ Manage Devices

Once the installation is complete, you can use the `manage_devices.sh` script to interact with the running devices.

### **Viewing Device Output**

To view the real-time output of a running device, run:

```sh
bash manage_devices.sh
```

1. Select **"View a device's output"** from the menu.
2. Choose the device from the numbered list.
3. The terminal will attach to the deviceâ€™s `tmux` session, showing live output.
4. To **detach** (without stopping the device), press `Ctrl+B`, then `D` (or type `tmux detach` and enter).

### **Stopping a Running Device**

To stop a device that is currently running:

```sh
bash manage_devices.sh
```

1. Select **"Stop a running device"** from the menu.
2. Choose the device from the numbered list.
3. The selected device will be stopped immediately.

### **Checking Running Devices**

To check which devices are currently running, use:

```sh
tmux ls
```

This will list all active `tmux` sessions, which correspond to running devices.

### **Manually Starting Devices**

If you want to manually start a device without adding it to startup:

```sh
tmux new-session -d -s <device_name> "python /path/to/device_script.py"
```

This will run the selected device in the background using `tmux`.
